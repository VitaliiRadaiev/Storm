                                    Once a new building’s construction has been completed, businesses are keen to move into their new space and it’s not long before the moving trucks begin to arrive, and the office furniture is put into place, desks are set up and the IT equipment is installed.

                            However, before any furniture is put in or IT equipment set up, the entire office should be cleaned thoroughly. There is usually a considerable amount of dust and debris left over that gets forgotten about, especially if carpet has been laid, and can therefore have repercussions later. How?

                            If there is any dust or debris left after construction has been completed, and you start moving in your furniture and equipment, these particles might affect their operation and could result in having to replace items earlier than anticipated and increasing the expenses related to the renovation and moving. Not only this, but dust and debris could be harmful to your employees!
