                                Professor Charlie Teo is a leading neurosurgeon in demand across the globe, known for
                                offering surgery to brain cancer patients who have been given no hope.

                                Brain cancer kills more children in Australia than any other disease and more people
                                under 40 than any other cancer. The worst type of brain cancer, GBM, is also the most
                                common and has an average survival of only 15 months from diagnosis.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “I have been raising funds for brain cancer research for the last 30 years. It
                                absolutely breaks my heart to say that with all that money and all that effort, survival
                                rates for brain cancer patients have not improved in over 35 years.”

                            </p>

                                Charlie launched the Charlie Teo Foundation in 2018 to shake-up the way funds are raised
                                for brain cancer research and to seek out those brilliant, original minds to go where no
                                brain cancer researcher has gone before.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The sole focus of the Charlie Teo Foundation is to offer hope by funding brilliant and
                                'out of the box' brain cancer researchers and thinkers to find a cure for brain cancer.
                                The Foundation is proactively targeting these people from around the globe for the
                                benefit of brain cancer patients in Australia.

                                Charlie Teo Foundation is based on a low-cost model that’s redefining how charities
                                operate. The Foundation runs lean by embracing volunteerism and careful management to
                                keep costs low. Currently at least 80c in each dollar given goes to research. We hope to
                                make this even better over time.

                                “I think the problem is lack of awareness... If the public understood the enormous
                                negative impact that brain cancer has on our society, they would fund it. They would
                                make noise, and get their politicians to fund it. The number one thing you can do is
                                just start the conversation. Go back and tell everyone the cold hard truth about brain
                                cancer”
